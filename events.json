However, existing methods often rely on soft penalties, which are insufficient. In this talk, I will introduce hard-constrained neural networks (HardNet), a general framework for enforcing hard, input-dependent constraints by appending a differentiable enforcement layer to any neural network. This approach enables end-to-end training and, crucially, is proven to preserve the network's universal approximation capabilities, ensuring model expressivity is not sacrificed. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of HardNet across various applications: (1) learning with piecewise constraints, (2) learning optimization solvers with guaranteed feasibility, and (3) optimizing control policies in safety-critical systems. This framework can be used even for problems where the constraints themselves are not fully known and must be learned from data in a parametric form, for which I will present two key applications: (1) data-driven control with inherent Lyapunov stability and (2) learning chaotic dynamical systems with guaranteed boundedness. Together, these results demonstrate a unified methodology for embedding formal constraints into deep learning, paving the way for more reliable AI.</p><h4>Related papers</h4><ul><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10807\">HardNet: Hard-Constrained Neural Networks with Universal Approximation Guarantees</a></li><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03157\">CoILS: Data-Driven Control with Inherent Lyapunov Stability</a></li><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00976\">Learning Chaotic Dynamics with Embedded Dissipativity</a></li></ul><h3>Bio</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Navid Azizan is the Alfred H.

The prefix 'semi' in a semi-Markov chain refers to arbitrary state sojourns, in stark contrast to a first-order discrete-time time-homogeneous Markov chain, which implicitly has geometric (memory-less) sojourns for each of its states. To compute our estimators we use a natural-number-valued process which counts the number of time steps since the chain entered its current state. Augmenting a semi-Markov chain with this process we get a new joint process which is a first-order time-homogeneous Markov chain on a lattice-based state space. The mapping we use from the primary state-space for a semi-Markov chain up\u00a0 to the lattice-based state space is a bijective map. Consequently, we can perform our estimation tasks on the lattice-based state space, ' as if ' our observations were generated by a first-order time-homogeneous Markov chain. Estimates for the semi-Markov chain are then recovered through an adjoint map. Semi-Markov chains contain Markov chains as a special degenerate case when all sojourns are taken as geometric. This correspondence in our estimators is shown. We finish with a simulation study of our estimators for a partially observed 3-state semi-Markov model with sojourn models ; 1.) a Dirac distribution on 5, 2.) a geometric distribution and\u00a0 3.) a distribution on sojourns 2, 3 and 5 time steps only.\u00a0</p><h3>Bio</h3><p>W.
