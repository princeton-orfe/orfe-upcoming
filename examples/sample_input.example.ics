SUMMARY:Elynn Chen\, New York University
CLASS:PUBLIC
DESCRIPTION:Abstract: Most learning-and-decision systems assume a single\, 
 homogeneous response to actions. In practice—marketing\, healthcare\, op
 erations—outcomes vary across unobserved segments. This talk develops a 
 data-driven framework for decision making under latent heterogeneity\, whe
 re each individual belongs to an unknown group and group membership is pro
 babilistic and feature-driven. I will focus on a linear contextual bandit 
 model with a logistic “gating” rule for membership and group-specific 
 linear rewards\, and present an exploration-free\, phased algorithm that j
 ointly learns the gate and the

DESCRIPTION:AbstractIncorporating prior knowledge and domain-specific input
 -output requirements\, such as safety or stability\, as hard constraints i
 nto neural networks is a key enabler for their deployment in high-stakes a
 pplications. However\, existing methods often rely on soft penalties\, whi
 ch are insufficient. In this talk\, I will introduce hard-constrained neur
 al networks (HardNet)\, a general framework for enforcing hard\, input-dep
 endent constraints by appending a differentiable enforcement layer to any 
 neural network. This approach enables end-to-end training and\, crucially\

DESCRIPTION:AbstractWe study how multi-head softmax attention models are tr
 ained to perform in-context learning on linear data. Through extensive emp
 irical experiments and rigorous theoretical analysis\, we demystify the em
 ergence of elegant attention patterns: a diagonal and homogeneous pattern 
 in the key-query weights\, and a last-entry-only and zero-sum pattern in t
 he output-value weights.Remarkably\, these patterns consistently appear fr
 om gradient-based training starting from random initialization.Our analysi
 s reveals that such emergent structures enable multi-head attention to

 useful characteristics\; and establish asymptotic normality for the SDF lo
